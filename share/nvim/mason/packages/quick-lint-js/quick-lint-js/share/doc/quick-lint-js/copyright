>                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
> 
>  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

>                             Preamble
> 
>   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
> software and other kinds of works.
> 
>   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
> to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
> the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
> share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
> software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
> GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
> any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
> these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
> certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
> you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
> freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
> or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
> know their rights.
> 
>   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
> (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
> giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
> 
>   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
> that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
> authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
> changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
> authors of previous versions.
> 
>   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
> modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
> can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
> protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
> pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
> use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
> have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
> products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
> stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
> of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
> 
>   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
> software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
> avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
> make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
> patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
>                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
>   0. Definitions.
> 
>   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
> 
>   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
> works, such as semiconductor masks.
> 
>   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
> License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
> "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
> 
>   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
> in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
> exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
> earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
> 
>   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
> on the Program.
> 
>   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
> permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
> infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
> computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
> distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
> public, and in some countries other activities as well.
> 
>   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
> parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
> a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
> 
>   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
> to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
> feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
> tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
> extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
> work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
> the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
> menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
> 
>   1. Source Code.
> 
>   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
> for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
> form of a work.
> 
>   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
> standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
> interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
> is widely used among developers working in that language.
> 
>   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
> than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
> packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
> Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
> Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
> implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
> "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
> (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
> (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
> produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
> 
>   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
> the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
> work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
> control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
> System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
> programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
> which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
> includes interface definition files associated with source files for
> the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
> linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
> such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
> subprograms and other parts of the work.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
> can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
> Source.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
> same work.
> 
>   2. Basic Permissions.
> 
>   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
> copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
> conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
> permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
> covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
> content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
> rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
> 
>   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
> convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
> in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
> of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
> with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
> the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
> not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
> for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
> and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
> your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
> 
>   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
> the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
> makes it unnecessary.
> 
>   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
> 
>   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
> measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
> 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
> similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
> measures.
> 
>   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
> circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
> is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
> the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
> modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
> users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
> technological measures.
> 
>   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
> 
>   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
> receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
> keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
> non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
> keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
> recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
>   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
> and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
> 
>   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
> 
>   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
> produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
> terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
>     it, and giving a relevant date.
> 
>     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
>     released under this License and any conditions added under section
>     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
>     "keep intact all notices".
> 
>     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
>     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
>     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
>     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
>     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
>     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
>     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
> 
>     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
>     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
>     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
>     work need not make them do so.
> 
>   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
> works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
> and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
> in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
> "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
> used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
> beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
> in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
> parts of the aggregate.
> 
>   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
> 
>   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
> of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
> machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
> in one of these ways:
> 
>     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
>     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
>     customarily used for software interchange.
> 
>     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
>     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
>     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
>     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
>     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
>     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
>     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
>     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
>     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
>     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
> 
>     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
>     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
>     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
>     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
>     with subsection 6b.
> 
>     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
>     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
>     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
>     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
>     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
>     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
>     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
>     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
>     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
>     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
>     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
>     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
> 
>     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
>     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
>     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
>     charge under subsection 6d.
> 
>   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
> from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
> included in conveying the object code work.
> 
>   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
> tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
> or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
> into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
> doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
> product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
> typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
> of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
> actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
> is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
> commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
> the only significant mode of use of the product.
> 
>   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
> procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
> and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
> a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
> suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
> code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
> modification has been made.
> 
>   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
> specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
> part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
> User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
> fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
> Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
> by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
> if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
> modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
> been installed in ROM).
> 
>   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
> requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
> for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
> the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
> network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
> adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
> protocols for communication across the network.
> 
>   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
> in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
> documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
> source code form), and must require no special password or key for
> unpacking, reading or copying.
> 
>   7. Additional Terms.
> 
>   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
> License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
> Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
> be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
> that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
> apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
> under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
> this License without regard to the additional permissions.
> 
>   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
> remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
> it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
> removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
> additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
> for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
> add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
> that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
> 
>     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
>     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
> 
>     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
>     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
>     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
> 
>     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
>     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
>     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
> 
>     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
>     authors of the material; or
> 
>     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
>     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
> 
>     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
>     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
>     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
>     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
>     those licensors and authors.
> 
>   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
> restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
> received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
> governed by this License along with a term that is a further
> restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
> a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
> License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
> of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
> not survive such relicensing or conveying.
> 
>   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
> must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
> additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
> where to find the applicable terms.
> 
>   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
> form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
> the above requirements apply either way.
> 
>   8. Termination.
> 
>   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
> provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
> modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
> this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
> paragraph of section 11).
> 
>   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
> license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
> provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
> finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
> holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
> prior to 60 days after the cessation.
> 
>   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
> reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
> violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
> received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
> copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
> your receipt of the notice.
> 
>   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
> licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
> this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
> reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
> material under section 10.
> 
>   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
> 
>   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
> run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
> occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
> to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
> nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
> modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
> not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
> covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
> 
>   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
> 
>   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
> receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
> propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
> for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
> 
>   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
> organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
> organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
> work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
> transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
> licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
> give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
> Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
> the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
> 
>   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
> rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
> not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
> rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
> (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
> any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
> sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
> 
>   11. Patents.
> 
>   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
> License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
> work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
> 
>   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
> owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
> hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
> by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
> but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
> consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
> purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
> patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
> this License.
> 
>   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
> patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
> make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
> propagate the contents of its contributor version.
> 
>   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
> agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
> (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
> sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
> party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
> patent against the party.
> 
>   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
> and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
> to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
> publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
> then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
> available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
> patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
> consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
> license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
> actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
> covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
> in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
> country that you have reason to believe are valid.
> 
>   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
> arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
> covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
> receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
> or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
> you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
> work and works based on it.
> 
>   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
> the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
> conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
> specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
> work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
> in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
> to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
> the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
> parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
> patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
> conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
> for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
> contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
> or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
> 
>   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
> any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
> otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
> 
>   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
> 
>   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
> covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
> not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
> to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
> the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
> License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
> 
>   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
> permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
> under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
> combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
> License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
> but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
> section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
> combination as such.
> 
>   14. Revised Versions of this License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
> the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
> Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
> Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
> option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
> version or of any later version published by the Free Software

> This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
> permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
> 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
> bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
> the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
> 
> When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
> certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
> program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
> non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
> header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
> 
> 0. Definitions.
> 
> A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
> Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
> interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
> on the Runtime Library.
> 
> "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
> modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
> the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
> subsequent versions published by the FSF.
> 
> "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
> modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
> the license of GCC.
> 
> "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
> target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
> input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
> phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
> format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
> for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
> 
> The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
> non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
> Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
> use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
> part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
> understood as starting with the output of the generators or
> preprocessors.
> 
> A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
> with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
> work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
> optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
> Eligible Compilation Process.
> 
> 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
> 
> You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
> combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
> propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
> all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
> may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
> consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
> 
> 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
> 
> The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
> presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
> requirements of the license of GCC.

> This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
> permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
> 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
> bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
> the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
> 
> When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
> certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
> program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
> non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
> header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
> 
> 0. Definitions.
> 
> A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
> Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
> interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
> on the Runtime Library.
> 
> "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
> modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
> the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
> subsequent versions published by the FSF.
> 
> "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
> modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
> the license of GCC.
> 
> "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
> target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
> input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
> phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
> format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
> for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
> 
> The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
> non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
> Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
> use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
> part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
> understood as starting with the output of the generators or
> preprocessors.
> 
> A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
> with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
> work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
> optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
> Eligible Compilation Process.
> 
> 1. Grant of Additional Permission.
> 
> You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
> combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
> propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
> all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
> may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
> consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
> 
> 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
> 
> The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
> presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
> requirements of the license of GCC.
